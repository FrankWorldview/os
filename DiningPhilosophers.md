# üçΩÔ∏è Dining Philosophers in Java: Discussion Notes

## 1. Why `notifyAll()` is Safer Than `notify()`

In **solution 1**, using `notify()` wakes **only one waiting philosopher**, and there's **no control** over which thread is awakened. If the awakened philosopher is **not eligible to eat** (i.e., one of her neighbors is currently eating), she will return to `wait()` ‚Äî and **no progress is made**.

Using `notifyAll()` wakes **all waiting philosophers**, allowing **any eligible philosopher** to re-check the condition and proceed. Those who still cannot eat will simply go back to `wait()`.

> üîë `notifyAll()` prevents missed signals and avoids potential deadlocks caused by unlucky thread scheduling.

## 2. Comparing Solution 1 (`synchronized`) and Solution 3 (`ReentrantLock + Condition`)

| Aspect               | Solution 1: `synchronized` + `wait()` / `notifyAll()` | Solution 3: `ReentrantLock` + `Condition[]`           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Simplicity**   | ‚úÖ Built-in and easy to use                             | ‚ùå More verbose and manual setup required              |
| **Notification**     | ‚ùå `notifyAll()` wakes all threads (even unnecessary ones) | ‚úÖ `signal()` wakes only the relevant philosopher    |
| **Granularity**      | ‚ùå Coarse-grained control                               | ‚úÖ Fine-grained control via per-philosopher `Condition` |
| **Fairness**         | ‚ùå No fairness guarantee                                | ‚úÖ Can enforce fairness using `new ReentrantLock(true)` |
| **Performance**      | ‚ùå Potential spurious wakeups                           | ‚úÖ Efficient signalling avoids unnecessary wakeups      |

> ‚úÖ **Solution 1** is suitable for basic concurrency demonstrations.  
> ‚öôÔ∏è **Solution 3** is better for fine-tuned and scalable concurrent programs.

## 3. Starvation Awareness (All Solutions)

None of the current implementations are guaranteed to be **starvation-free**.

Even with fair locking (as in `ReentrantLock(true)`), a philosopher might:
- Be eligible to eat,
- But **always lose the race** to other threads due to scheduling.

> üß† **Exercise:** How can you modify these implementations to make them starvation-free?

### Suggestions for Starvation-Free Enhancements:
- Implement a **queue** of waiting philosophers (first-come, first-served).
- Use a **round-robin** turn system.
- Track **wait times** and prioritise those who've waited longest.
- Use **fair semaphores** or scheduler-aware logic.

---

## üìö Summary

- ‚úÖ All three solutions are **deadlock-free** as implemented.
- ‚ùå None are **starvation-free** without further logic.
- `notifyAll()` is critical in monitor-style implementations to ensure **no missed progress**.
- `ReentrantLock + Condition` allows more control and better scalability for complex cases.
